"Laravel Rule Object"

Laravel has provided us wit many built-in validations such as "unique, required" and we can use
them by simply writing the keywords and laravel will recognize it and activate the rules however
we can also make our own custom rules in laravel and use them in our contollers.

To make the "custom rule object" we need to first run the following command as shown below
"php artisan make:rule TestRule"

This will make a new directory inside the main app directory

Inside this rule file, we have few things, first is the "passes()" method which has 2 arguments
called "$attribute" and "$value" and this will return either true or false. There is a second
function called the "message()" and this is going to send us the error messages if the user did
not pass the rule/validation.
